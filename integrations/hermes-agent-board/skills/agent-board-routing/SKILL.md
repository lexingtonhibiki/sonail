# Agent Board Routing

## Trigger

Load this skill when Dan explicitly delegates project work to a named coding agent, for example:

- “Have Claude implement…”
- “Send this to Codex”
- “Use Copilot to fix…”
- “Have Grok work on…”
- “Put this on the Agent Board and run it”

Do not route general coding questions, comparisons, hypotheticals, quoted examples, or requests that explicitly say not to start work.

## Procedure

1. Call `agent_board_list_projects` when the project is not already identified by a canonical Board project ID
2. Resolve only an exact ID, exact project name, or unique project alias. Never silently use the Default project
3. Call `agent_board_list_agents` and confirm the explicitly requested agent is available. Never silently substitute another agent
4. Build a bounded execution contract containing:
   - objective
   - requirements and non-goals
   - acceptance criteria
   - relevant files or context
   - verification commands or expected checks
   - safety boundaries
5. Call `agent_board_route_task` with `auto_start=true` unless Dan said to queue it without starting
6. Return the project, agent, card ID, direct Board link, branch, and current status
7. Follow-ups for an active card should use `agent_board_send_message`, not create a duplicate card
8. Continuation of stopped/completed work must call `agent_board_route_task` with `existing_task` so the durable card ID is reused. New work that is connected but distinct must use `related_item`; never encode relationships with group IDs
9. Resolve projects and item references only by exact ID, exact name/title, or a unique alias. If the Board reports ambiguity, stop and ask rather than guessing
10. Use `agent_board_get_task` to check status when Dan asks for progress
11. Use `timeout_minutes` for work expected to exceed the 60-minute Board default. If a task times out, call `agent_board_retry_task` on the existing card with a larger limit; never bypass tracking by launching the named coding agent directly

## Safety

An explicit delegation authorizes card creation, isolated branch/worktree creation, repository-local edits, and ordinary tests. It does not authorize pushing, opening or merging a PR, merging locally, publishing, deploying, changing external accounts, destructive migrations, secret changes, or irreversible cleanup

Unknown projects, unavailable agents, ambiguous routing, or dirty-checkout dependencies must block cleanly rather than guess. Agent completion moves work to Review, not Done

## Multiple tasks

For multiple tasks, create separate cards only when the lanes are genuinely independent. Keep dependent steps in one card. Parallel write-capable tasks must use separate worktrees
